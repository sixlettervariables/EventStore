	//
	// for retrieval, if you have the key then you can always get the value
	// if you have the hash then what? //qq
	// and you can iterate through everything.

		//qq it is required that the key we use is already checked for collisions.

		// streams doesn't actually exist, then the index check cant detect the collision, and one
		// streams metadata may overwrite the other.
		// put another way, this violates the requirement that we check the keys for collisions with
		// other keys before using them to store data against here, because we can only check for
		// collisions of things actually present in the log. or put a third way, only names in the log
		// can be used as keys.
		//
		// SO we can't use the stream names as keys in the map - we have to use the metadata stream names
		// will that work? should do. we will key against the metadta streams, because indeed every
		// stream that needs scavenging is associated with a metadata stream. when we scavenge a chunk we
