	//qq this summary comment will explain the general shape of the scavenge state - what it needs to be
	// able to store and retrieve and why.
	//
	// There are two kinds of streams that we might want to remove events from
	//    - original streams
	//        - according to tombstone
	//        - according to metadata (maxage, maxcount, tb)
	//    - metadata streams
	//        - according to tombstone
	//        - maxcount 1
	//
	// Together these are the scavengable streams. We store a DiscardPoint for each so that we can
	// 
	// We only need to store metadata for the user streams with metadata since the metadata for
	// metadatastreams is implicit.
	// 
	// however, we need to know about _all_ the stream collisions in the database not just the ones
	// that we might remove events from, so that later we can scavenge the index without looking anything
	// up in the log.


	// accumulator iterates through the log, spotting metadata records
	// put in the data that the chunk and ptable scavenging require

		// it doesn't need to do anything with the metadata streams, accumulator has done those.
