			// than the original... limited concern because of the threshold above BUT we could address
			// by either
			//   - improving the posmap 
			//   - using a padding/scavengedevent system event to prevent having to write a posmap
			// this is the kind of decision we can make in here, local to the chunk.
			// knowing the numrecordstodiscard could be useful here, if we are just discarding a small
			// number then we'd probably pad them with 'gone' events instead of adding a posmap.

			// in ExecuteChunk could also be a reasonable place to do a best effort at removing commit
			// records if all the prepares for the commit are in this chunk (typically the case) and they
			// are all scavenged, then we can remove the commit as well i think. this is probably what
			// the old scavenge does. check

			// old scavenge says 'never delete the very first prepare in a transaction'
			// hopefully we can account for that here? although maybe it means our count of
			// records to scavenge that was calculated index only might end up being approximate.

			// 1. open the chunk, probably with the bulk reader

			//qq do this with a strategy so we can plug bulk reader in.
			
			//qq is the one in the chunkinstructions a logical chunk number or physical?

				// since we have the record here, we could look up the maxage and discard the event based
				// on that. note we shouldn't do this in the index since there we don't already have the
				// record and it would be more expensive to look it up. but the index is fine with us
				// removing events from the log without removing them from the index
