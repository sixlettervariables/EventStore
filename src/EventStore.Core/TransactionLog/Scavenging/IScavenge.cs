	// we dont run the next scavenge until the previous one has finished
	// which means we can be sure that the current discard points have been executed
	// (i.e. events before them removed) NO THIS IS NOT TRUE, the chunk might have been
	// below the threshold and not been scavenged. NO THIS IS TRUE as long as we require the
	// index to be scavenged.
	//
	// 1. what happens to the discard points, can we reuse them, do we need to recalculate them
	//    do we need to be careful when we recalculate them to take account of what was there before?
	// 2. in fact as this^ question of each part of the scavengestate.
	//
	//qq in the accumulator consider what should happen if the metadata becomes less restrictive
	// should we allow events that were previously excluded to re-appear.
	//  - we presumably dont want to allow cases where reads throw errors
	//  - if we want to be able to move the dp to make it less restrictive, then we need to
	//    store enough data to make sure that we dont undo the application of a different
	//    influence of DP. i.e. we cant apply the TB directly to the DP in the accumulator,
	//    otherwise we wouldn't know whether it was TB or Tombstone that set it, and therefore
	//    whether it can expand if we relax the TB.
	//
	//qqqq if we stored the previous and current discard point then can tell
	// from the index which events are new to scavenge this time - if that helps us
	// significantly with anything?
	//
	//qq after a scavenge there are probaly some entries in the scavenge state that we can forget about
	// to save us having to iterate them next time. for example if it was tombtoned. and perhaps tb
	// as long as the tb was fully executed.


	//qq some events, like empty writes, do not contain data, presumably dont take up any numbering
	// see what old scavenge does with those and what we should do with them

	//qqqq TRANSACTIONS. these look ok
	// - is it possible that an uncommitted transaction could have a hash collision in
	// a way that we wouldn't detect but would be important? nah, because there is no such thing as a
	// collision except in the index. but we should have a tests that makes sure its ok when we have
	// uncommitted transactions that "collide"
	// - We don't need to support Metadata or Tombstones committed in transactions.
	//    we will detect it and abort with an error. //qq but do detect it and test this
	// So we are only concerned with prepares in transactions.
	//
	// Accumulator: all we do with these is
	// - check for collisions (which we can do regardless of whether the record is in a transaction
	//   or not)
	// - accumulate timestamps - and these are the timestamps of the preparation not the commit
	//   so we can just look at the timestamp of the record regardless of what it is and
	//   whether it is in the transaction.
	// so the Accumulator is fine just reading the chunk without resorting to the allreader
	//
	// Calculator:
	// - This reads EventInfo from the index, which by its nature does not know about uncommitted events
	//   or commit records
	// - So it wont account for uncommited events or commit records in the 'count to be scavenged'
	// - But the DP should, i think, be calculated correctly.
	// so i think the calculator is fine too.
	//
	// ChunkExecutor:
	// - we can only scavenge a record if we know what event number it is, for which we need the commit
	//   record. so perhaps we only scavenge the events in a transaction (and the commit record)
	//   if the transaction was committed in the same chunk that it was started. this is pretty much
	//   what the old scavenge does too.
	//
	// IndexExecutor:
	// - i think this is fine by virtue of only having any knowledge of committed things
	//
	//  TRANSACTIONS IN OLD SCAVENGE
	//   - looks like uncommitted prepares are generally kept, maybe unless the stream is hard deleted
	//   - looks like even committed prepares are only removed if the commit is in the same chunk
	// - uncommitted transactions are not present in the index, neither are commit records


	//qq perhaps scavenge points go in a scavenge point stream so they can be easily found

	//qq make it so that the scavenge state can be deleted and run again
	// if we delete the scavenge state and run a scavenge, do we want it to
	// process each scavenge point or just the last? presumably just the last because there could
	// be a lot of them.

	//qq consider compatibility with old scavenge
	// - config flag to choose which scavenge to run
	// - old by default
	// you definitely have to be able to run old scavenge first, thats typical.
	// will it work to run old scavenge after new scavenge? don't see why not
	// will it work to interleave them?
	// if we want to disable the old scavenge after running the new we could
	//    - bump the chunk schema version
	//    - have old scavenge check for scavengepoints and abort?

	//qq RESUMING SCAVENGE
	// need some comments about this. consider what checkpoints we need to store in the scavenge state
	//  - accumulated up to
	//  - calculated up to
	//  - executed up to?
	// and also recovery from crashing during a flush. idempotency

	//qqqq need comment/plan about EXPANDING metadatas.
	//   probably we want to follow the same behaviour as reads so that the visible data doesn't
	//   change when you run a scavenge.
	//qqqq need comment/plan about that flag that allows the last event to be removed.
	//qqqq need comment/plan on out of order and duplicate events

	//qq can you tombstone a metadata stream
	//qq if you tombstone a stream does it probably has no effect on the metadtaa stream since we
	// already scavenge all but the last event, and we want to keep the last event.

	//qq to consider in CollisionDetector any complications from previous index entries having been
	// scavenged.

	//qq note, probably need to complain if the ptable is a 32bit table

	//qq backup strategy: same as current, only take a backup while scavenge is not running. this is
	// point towards not having the accumulator running continuall too

	//qq dont forget about chunk merging.. maybe is that another phase after execution, or part of
	// execution.

	//qq DETERMINISTIC SCAVENGE
	// there are some interesting things to note/decide about this
	// - when we write the scavenge point, it is in the open chunk, which we can't scavenge.
	//   so at the time we write it, we cant scavenge up to the scavenge point.
	//   but if we scavenged later, we would be able to scavenge right up to it.
	//   but we want the scavenge to be deterministic, so perhaps it should always only scavenge
	//   up to the end of the chunk before the chunk containing the scavenge point.
	//   BUT what does it really mean to not scavenge the open chunk
	//     - can we accumulate the content of the open chunk?
	//     - can we calculate according to the content of the open chunk?
	//     - can we execute the index of things that are in the open chunk?
	//     - can we execute the open chunk itself?
	//    quite possibly the answer to all these except the last is yes and still keep determinism.
	//
	// - to be deterministic, we may want to the chunk weight threshold (and other things?
	//    unsafediscardtombstones?) properties of the ScavengePoint and instead of configuration options?
	//
	// - implications if the scavenge state is deleted, could we jump to the last scavenge point, or
	//   would we need to scavenge each in turn (hopefully the former)
	//
	// - new scavenge is deterministic but the current state is important, ponder these:
	//    - if old scavenge left the chunks in different states, new scavenge won't necessarily bring
	//      them in line, or will it.
	//    - if two nodes are at different points of the scavenge, then the chunks could be in different
	//      states
	//
	// - if we delete the scavenge state and want to rebuild it (say it is corrupted in a backup, say
	//   they took the backup while scavenge was running)
	//   then it would be sad if we had to rerun every scavenge point
	//   but if we can somehow jump to the last one, then perhaps a node that just hasnt been scavenged
	//   in several points could just jump to the last one also.
	//   in any of these cases getting the chunk version numbering right could be awkward, i wonder
	//   whether it is important.
	//   even if we have to jump through some hoops for the chunks, we pretty surely only need to
	//   scavenge the index once.
	//
	// - if we put the threshold in the scavenge points, perhaps to skip over scavenge points you just
	//   need to min/max the threshold.
	//
	// - if we could get a better idea of what goes wrong when you mix and match chunks today, then we
	//   could make sure that we could avoid those problems without being overly strict (like perhaps
	//   the chunk version numbering isnt important, perhaps the exact way that the chunks are merged
	//   isnt important. etc)



	//qq the hash collision detection is pretty key. it is how we efficiently scavenge the index.
	// if we don't spot what collisions there are, and simply calculate DiscardPoints and store them
	// against stream names, then (aside from the additional disk space, iops to read and write, seach
	// time to traverse that structure) we wouldn't be able to tell what the discard point is for any
	// given indexentry without looking up the log record to see what stream it is for. repeat for
	// _every_ indexentry.
	//
	// todo:
	// - start creating high level tests to test the scavenger (see how the old scavenge tests work, we
	//   may be able to use them - the effect of the scavenge ought to be pretty much identical to the
	//   user but the effect on the log will be different so may not be able to use exactly the same
	//   tests (e.g. we will drop in scavenge points, might not scavenge the same things exactly that
	//   are done on a best effort basis like commit records)
	// - once we have an idea or two from v20, port the code over to v5.
	// - port the ScavengeState tests over to the higher level tests
	// - pass through the doc in case there are more things to think about
	// - diagram out the components so we can get the big picture
	// - want the same unit tests to run against mock implementations and real implementations of
	//      the adapter interfaces ideally
	// - implement/test the rest of the logic in the scavenge (tdd)
	//     - tidying phase
	//     - stopping/resuming
	//     - ...
	// - implement/test the adapters that plug it in to the rest of the system

	//   - merged chunks
	//   - log record schema versions (esp wrt tombstones since it affects what the max value is)
	//   - ...
	//
	//
	//qq we can split the scavenge state by
	// - metadata vs original stream
	//    - downside, index executor doesn't know which map to look in. double lookup.
	// - metastreamdata vs discard point
	//    - i.e. store allll the discard points in one map
	// - all in one map
	//    - downside: wasted space, or complexity of variable length values
	//
	//qq REDACTION
	//  needs notes
	//
	//qq TOMBSTONES
	// tldr: tombstones do not necessarily have eventnumber int.maxvalue or long.maxvalue.
	// but they do have PrepareFlags.StreamDelete.
	//
	// Although the StorageWriterService does, these days, create tombstones with
	// EventNumber = EventNumber.DeletedStream the TFChunkScavenger, IndexComitter, and IndexWriter are
	// all geared up not to rely on that, but to rely on the prepareflags instead. It looks like they use
	// this to causes index.GetStreamLastEventNumber to return long.max (i.e. EventNumber.DeletedStream)
	// regardless of the eventnumber of the tombstone. SO lets assume that some old tombstones have other
	// eventnumbers and use the prepareflag to detect it.
	//
	// Note, if there is such a tombstone whose eventnumber is not long.max, then that means that its
	// event number in its indexentry would be different to its event number in the log.
	//
	// So, have done this:
	//  - go back to having a 'is tombstoned' flag
	//  - get rid of the 'tombstone' discard point. i.e. we keep them separate again.
	//  then
	//  - we can probably persist it in the sign bit of the discard point itself
	//  - then we have an explicit representation of tombstoning seprate to the discard point, which
	//    helps to simplify things
	//  - saves us from needing to spot tombtones (via their prepare flags) in the chunk executor,
	//    just obey the DP.
	//
	//qq OLD INDEX SCAVENGE TESTS
	// - there is no need to run these tests against new scavenge.
	// - in a nutshell they test the TableIndex (and PTables), which new and old scavenge both use.
	// - they just test that the tableindex scavenge works correctly given a function that determines
	//   whether to keep each index entry. in the tests this function is injected via the fakeReader
	//   and it (for example) trivially checks if the position is in a list of deleted positions.
	//   therefore these tests are assuming a correct shouldKeep method and checking that TableIndex
	//   responds appropriately (when index upgrades, cancellation, awaiting tables etc). there would be
	//   no advantage to running them again injecting our own dummy shouldkeep implementation.

	public class ScavengePoint {
		//qq do we want these to be explicit, or implied from the position/timestamp
		// of the scavenge point itself? questions is whether there is any need to scavenge
		// at a different time or place.

		public long Position { get; set; }
		public DateTime EffectiveNow { get; set; }
	}
}
