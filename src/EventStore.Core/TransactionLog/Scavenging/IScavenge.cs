	//         - we don't count commit records (but, i think, if we are able to scavenge a commit record
	//            then we will have increased the weight of the chunk for the sake of the event records	//

	// below the threshold and not been scavenged. NO THIS IS TRUE as long as we require the
	// index to be scavenged.
	//
	// 1. what happens to the discard points, can we reuse them, do we need to recalculate them
	//    do we need to be careful when we recalculate them to take account of what was there before?
	// 2. in fact ask this^ question of each part of the scavengestate.
	//
	//qq in the accumulator consider what should happen if the metadata becomes less restrictive
	// should we allow events that were previously excluded to re-appear.
	//  - we presumably dont want to allow cases where reads throw errors
	//  - if we want to be able to move the dp to make it less restrictive, then we need to
	//    store enough data to make sure that we dont undo the application of a different
	//    influence of DP. i.e. we cant apply the TB directly to the DP in the accumulator,
	//    otherwise we wouldn't know whether it was TB or Tombstone that set it, and therefore
	//    whether it can expand if we relax the TB.
	//
	//qqqq if we stored the previous and current discard point then can tell
	// from the index which events are new to scavenge this time - if that helps us
	// significantly with anything?
	//
	//qq after a scavenge there are probaly some entries in the scavenge state that we can forget about
	// to save us having to iterate them next time. for example if it was tombtoned. and perhaps tb
	// as long as the tb was fully executed. but we need to keep the discard points because the chunks
	// might not all have been executed.
	//
	// ACCUMULATOR
	// We previously accumulated up to the previous scavenge point.
	// We need to start from there and accumulate up to the new scavenge point.
	// So we just need to know where we accumulated up to.
	// Can we skip scavenge points? if so we can't tell where we accumulated up to from the previous scavenge point
	// we need to store it in the checkpoint.

	// CALCULATOR
	// ???
	// does something happen in the calculator to add weight to the chunk when some time has passed? yeah surely

	// CHUNK EXECUTOR
	// probably nothing too scary in here

	// INDEX EXECUTOR
	// probably reasonable

	// MERGE/TIDYUP

	// THEREFORE:
	// - checkpoints should contain the scavengepoint
	// - we dont pass the scavengepoint to the methods, we get it from the checkpoint
	// - the checkpoint can be passed to the components, or they could look it up from the state
	//    - we dont really want the compoennts to know where they come in the order wrt each other
	//          we want the scavenger to manage that.
	//    - SO we want to pass it in.
	//   - what do we want to pass in exactly, 










	// GDPR
	// the chunk weights are only approximate because
	//   - they dont include metadata records (there arent usually many of these per stream though)
	//   - they don't include uncommitted transactions
	// 
	// therefore gdpr limitations
	//   - dont put personal data in metadata, cant guarnatee it will get scavenged
	//   - dont put personal data in transactions, it wont (and never was) be scavenged if the
	//     transaction is committed in a different chunk to when it was opened, or if it was left open
	//     because that information is not local to the chunk we are scavenging.
	//       - although we _could_ accumulate a list of open transactions it seems like its an occasional
	//         batch operation that isn't quite the same thing as the scavenge, especially as
	//         transactions are legacy and not an ongoing concern.



	//qq perhaps scavenge points go in a scavenge point stream so they can be easily found

	//qq make it so that the scavenge state can be deleted and run again
	// if we delete the scavenge state and run a scavenge, do we want it to
	// process each scavenge point or just the last? presumably just the last because there could
	// be a lot of them.

	//qq consider compatibility with old scavenge
	// - config flag to choose which scavenge to run
	// - old by default
	// you definitely have to be able to run old scavenge first, thats typical.
	// will it work to run old scavenge after new scavenge? don't see why not
	// will it work to interleave them?
	/*
	 * > is it true that a stream's last event number before the scavenge point will not be scavenged?
		actually there is something to consider here
		if they put a scavenge point, wrote some more events, and then run an old scavenge and then run a new scavenge, it might not be true
		so if we need this property, we might need to add some limitation about how old/new scavenges can be run with respect to each other
	 */
	// if we want to disable the old scavenge after running the new we could
	//    - bump the chunk schema version
	//    - have old scavenge check for scavengepoints and abort?

	//qqqq need comment/plan about EXPANDING metadatas.
	//   probably we want to follow the same behaviour as reads so that the visible data doesn't
	//   change when you run a scavenge.
	//qqqq need comment/plan about that flag that allows the last event to be removed.
	//qqqq need comment/plan on out of order and duplicate events

	//qq note, probably need to complain if the ptable is a 32bit table

	//qq BACKUP STRATEGY: same as current, only take a backup while scavenge is not running. this is
	// point towards not having the accumulator running continuall too. see if the backup instrutions
	// will work, and see if the cli needs modifying

	//qq dont forget about chunk merging.. maybe is that another phase after execution, or part of
	// execution.




	//qq DETERMINISTIC SCAVENGE
	// there are some interesting things to note/decide about this
	// - when we write the scavenge point, it is in the open chunk, which we can't scavenge.
	//   so at the time we write it, we cant scavenge up to the scavenge point.
	//   but if we scavenged later, we would be able to scavenge right up to it.
	//   but we want the scavenge to be deterministic, so perhaps it should always only scavenge
	//   up to the end of the chunk before the chunk containing the scavenge point.
	//   BUT what does it really mean to not scavenge the open chunk
	//     - can we accumulate the content of the open chunk?
	//     - can we calculate according to the content of the open chunk?
	//     - can we execute the index of things that are in the open chunk?
	//     - can we execute the open chunk itself?
	//    quite possibly the answer to all these except the last is yes and still keep determinism.
	//
	// - to be deterministic, we may want to the chunk weight threshold (and other things?
	//    unsafediscardtombstones?) properties of the ScavengePoint and instead of configuration options?
	//
	// - implications if the scavenge state is deleted, could we jump to the last scavenge point, or
	//   would we need to scavenge each in turn (hopefully the former)
	//
	// - new scavenge is deterministic but the current state is important, ponder these:
	//    - if old scavenge left the chunks in different states, new scavenge won't necessarily bring
	//      them in line, or will it.
	//    - if two nodes are at different points of the scavenge, then the chunks could be in different
	//      states
	//
	// - if we delete the scavenge state and want to rebuild it (say it is corrupted in a backup, say
	//   they took the backup while scavenge was running)
	//   then it would be sad if we had to rerun every scavenge point
	//   but if we can somehow jump to the last one, then perhaps a node that just hasnt been scavenged
	//   in several points could just jump to the last one also.
	//   in any of these cases getting the chunk version numbering right could be awkward, i wonder
	//   whether it is important.
	//   even if we have to jump through some hoops for the chunks, we pretty surely only need to
	//   scavenge the index once.
	//
	// - if we put the threshold in the scavenge points, perhaps to skip over scavenge points you just
	//   need to min/max the threshold.
	//
	// - if we could get a better idea of what goes wrong when you mix and match chunks today, then we
	//   could make sure that we could avoid those problems without being overly strict (like perhaps
	//   the chunk version numbering isnt important, perhaps the exact way that the chunks are merged
	//   isnt important. etc)






	//
	// todo:
	// - start creating high level tests to test the scavenger (see how the old scavenge tests work, we
	//   may be able to use them - the effect of the scavenge ought to be pretty much identical to the
	//   user but the effect on the log will be different so may not be able to use exactly the same
	//   tests (e.g. we will drop in scavenge points, might not scavenge the same things exactly that
	//   are done on a best effort basis like commit records)
	// - port the ScavengeState tests over to the higher level tests
	// - pass through the doc in case there are more things to think about
	// - want the same unit tests to run against mock implementations and real implementations of
	//      the adapter interfaces ideally
	// - implement/test the rest of the logic in the scavenge (tdd)

	//       because it won't be obvious that the discard point represents a tombstone. some cases later
	//       _might_ involve moving the DiscardPoint backwards but we must not do that if it represents
	//       a tombstone. For now keep it simple and obvious and store the istombstone explicitly
	//       and _not_ in the discard point. however dont keep it for metastreams, the discard point
	//       set by the accumulator accurately describes the required effect, and there are no
	//       complications of having other metadata affect it for metadata streams.
	// 
	// Note Metadata streams cannot be tombstoned abort if we find something like this.
	//
	// Although the StorageWriterService does, these days, create tombstones with
	// EventNumber = EventNumber.DeletedStream the TFChunkScavenger, IndexComitter, and IndexWriter are
	// all geared up not to rely on that, but to rely on the prepareflags instead. It looks like they use
	// this to causes index.GetStreamLastEventNumber to return long.max (i.e. EventNumber.DeletedStream)
	// regardless of the eventnumber of the tombstone. SO lets assume that some old tombstones have other
	// eventnumbers and use the prepareflag to detect it.
	//
	// Note, if there is such a tombstone whose eventnumber is not long.max, then that means that its
	// event number in its indexentry would be different to its event number in the log.
	//
	// Therefore we can't just have the Accumulator set the DP to max on tombstone - because that might
	// discard the tombstone itself. The accumulator would have to set the DP to discard before the
	// tombstones actual position. But then it wouldn't be obvious that the DP represents a tombstone.
	//
	// For original streams lets keep it simple and set an explicit IsTombstoned flag. The calculator
	// can take that into account when calculating the discard points. Its possible we could have the
	// accumulator bake the tombstone into the DP instead to save us storing the flag, but we would then
	// have two places setting the discard points for normal streams so be careful. come back to this
	// later and we can check what places are accessing the IsTombstoned flag. Similarly for TB
	//
	//  - we can probably persist the flag in the sign bit of the discard point itself




	//qq OLD INDEX SCAVENGE TESTS
	// - there is no need to run these tests against new scavenge.
	// - in a nutshell they test the TableIndex (and PTables), which new and old scavenge both use.
	// - they just test that the tableindex scavenge works correctly given a function that determines
	//   whether to keep each index entry. in the tests this function is injected via the fakeReader
	//   and it (for example) trivially checks if the position is in a list of deleted positions.
	//   therefore these tests are assuming a correct shouldKeep method and checking that TableIndex
	//   responds appropriately (when index upgrades, cancellation, awaiting tables etc). there would be
	//   no advantage to running them again injecting our own dummy shouldkeep implementation.
	//
	//qq make sure whenever we are cashing to prepare and accessing eventnumber that we are coping with
	// it being part of a transaction
	//qq make sure we never interact with index entries beyong the scavengepoint because we don't know
	// whether they are collisions or not

	//qq add a test that covers a chunk becoming empty on scavenge
	// these are json serialized in the checkpoint
	public class ScavengePoint {
		//qq do we want these to be explicit, or implied from the position/timestamp
		// of the scavenge point itself? questions is whether there is any need to scavenge
		// at a different time or place.
		//qq consider that at the time we place the scavenge point it is not in a scavengable chunk
		//   we should probably capture that behaviour here and have Position (rename to
		//   EffectivePosition?) return the point that we can really scavenge up to, whatever that is.

		public long Position { get; set; }
		public DateTime EffectiveNow { get; set; }
